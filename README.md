# ISL-Project

### Indian Sign Language Translation Platform

**Developed by:** Mr. Nobody

---

# 📌 Project Overview

The **Indian Sign Language (ISL) Translation Platform** is a web-based system that converts **English text or speech into Indian Sign Language** using a **3D animated avatar**.

The platform aims to improve communication between **hearing individuals and people who are deaf or speech-impaired** by translating spoken or written language into **visual sign language gestures**.

The system uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **3D animation technology** to generate realistic hand gestures performed by a digital avatar in real time.

# 🎯 Objectives

* Convert **English text into Indian Sign Language**
* Support **speech-to-text input for translation**
* Provide **real-time sign language animation**
* Improve accessibility for **deaf and speech-impaired users**
* Create an **interactive learning and demonstration tool**

# ⚙️ Technologies Used

## Frontend

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Three.js (3D rendering)

## Backend

* Python
* Flask

## Natural Language Processing

* NLTK

## 3D Animation

* FBX Character Model
* Mixamo Rigging
* Bone-based animation system

---

# 🧠 System Workflow

1. The user enters **text or uses voice input**.
2. The input is sent to the **Flask backend server**.
3. NLP processing converts the sentence into **ISL word order**.
4. The processed words are returned to the frontend.
5. The **3D avatar performs sign gestures sequentially**.
6. Each word is visually highlighted while its gesture is played.
